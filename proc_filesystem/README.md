# **Python :snake: - /proc filesystem**

## **Learnings**

- What is the /proc filesystem <br>
	The ***`proc filesystem`*** acts as an interface to internal data structures in the kernel. <br>
	Therefore, it can be used to retrieve informations about the system, and also for changing certain kernel parameters at runtime (sysctl). <br>
	So our ***`proc/ filesystem`*** provides a view of the current state of the kernel, processes, and system resources as a hierarchy of files and directoryes. <br>
	It is also called a "virtual filesystem", which means it does not exist on the disk, but dynamically generated by the kernel and populated on the fly.
	> For Example:
	- we can use `/proc/cpuinfo` to get about infos about CPU
	- we can use `/proc/meminfo` for infos about memory usage
	- we can use `/proc/sys` to get and set kernel parameters <br>
	<br>

Note that some tools and utilities in Linux uses the `/proc` filesystem to gather infos, for example => the famous ***`ps`*** command reads information from `/proc` to display a list of running processes on the system, you can also think about ***`top`*** command which uses `/proc` also to display system resource usage in real time, Yay ! <br>
==> If you want to take a look at what proc filesystem contains, you may run > cat /proc/self/status (or replace self with a valid PID)
