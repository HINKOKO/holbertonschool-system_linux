# **CPython :snake:**

### **What the hell is that**

**CPython** is the reference implementation of the Python programming language, written in ...C <br>
Alongside with **CPython** you may encounter "PyPy", "Jython", "IronPython"... and others, but CPython remains the most popular and well maintained refeence, the default and most widefy used.
However it would be false to say that all Python programming language lies into CPython -> Indeed, there's some implementations details that you won't find in CPython.
We could rather say that Python is defined **partly** by the **_Python Language Reference_** and partly by its main implementation, **_CPython_**. <br>

In this project folder, we use the Python/C API that CPython provides, which allows to extend Python with C code, and embed Python inside C !
