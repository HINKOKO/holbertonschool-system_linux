# **Practice makes it perfect**

Huge Thanks to [Mia Combeau](https://www.codequoi.com/en/threads-mutexes-and-concurrent-programming-in-c/) from 42 School.<br>

These little programs helped me a lot to understand thread creations, mutexes, locking/unlocking, destroying, and deadlocks. <br>

I learned tips for coloring the output of printf(), and tips about compilation GCC and valgrind. <br>

Compile those files with

```
gcc -pthread

```
