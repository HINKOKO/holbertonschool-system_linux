# **C - Static variables, getline**

## **Learnings**

- **What are static variables?**
In C programming, a **static variable** is a variable that retains its value between function calls.
When you declare a variable as ``static`` it is created in the data segment of memory and initialized to zero by default. <br>
They are accessible throughout the entire lifetime of the program and can be used multiple times.

- **How and when to use them?**
I guess we need to use them for the race car program ! :smile:
